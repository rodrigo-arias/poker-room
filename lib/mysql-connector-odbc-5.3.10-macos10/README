INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source or binary distribution of ODBC for 
MySQL. This software is distributed with restrictions - please
see the license information for details.

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a widely accepted standard
for reading/writing data. ODBC is designed in a similar manner
to the MS Windows printing system in that it has a Driver Manager
and Drivers. MySQL Connector/ODBC is a driver for the ODBC system 
which allows applications to communicate with the MySQL Server 
using the ODBC standard. ODBC implementations exist on all popular
platforms and MySQL Connector/ODBC is also available on those 
platforms. 

Oracle provides MySQL support for ODBC by means of the MySQL
Connector/ODBC driver and programs. MySQL Connector/ODBC is the
ODBC driver for MySQL which is ODBC 3.5x compliant; MyODBC is
ODBC 2.5x compliant.

To get all functionality from the ODBC 5.3 driver (e.g. 
transaction support) you should use it against MySQL Database 
Server 4.1 or later.

BUILDING SOURCE
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the BUILD file for details on building the source
code. This is included with the source distribution.

INSTALLING
---------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the INSTALL file for details on installing.

BINARY FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following, key, files are provided by MySQL Connector/ODBC
(the MS Windows names are included for reference but the file 
names for other platforms would be similar).

Driver (myodbc5a.dll and myodbc5w.dll)

     The most important part of Connector/ODBC is the driver.
     Application developers can link directly to the driver but 
     more often use the driver indirectly, via a Driver Manager
     such as the one provided by Microsoft or unixODBC.

     There is an ANSI version, myodbc5a.dll, and an Unicode
     version, myodbc5w.dll, of the driver.

     Many options can be provided to the driver to adjust its
     behavior. 

Setup Library (myodbc5S.dll)

     The setup library provides a graphical user interface needed
     during certain activities provided by the driver. For example;
     it provides the GUI when you use the ODBC Administrator to
     create/edit a Data Source Name (DSN).

Installer (myodbc-installer.exe)

     This command-line utility program can be used to manage ODBC
     system information. For example it can be used to register
     or deregister a driver. It can also manage data source names.
     This was created to test the ODBC system information
     abstraction and portability layer within Connector/ODBC but 
     is also useful for installing and uninstalling Connector/ODBC.

     Invoke myodbc-installer.exe, in a command shell and without
     options, to get help on its use.

Library Loading Tester (dltest.exe)

     This command-line utility is useful for debugging problems
     related to loading a library and resolving symbols in it.

Connector/ODBC SDK
---------------------------------------------------------------

MySQL Connector/ODBC provides an SDK for developers in the form 
of several reusable libraries. These libraries can be used to 
save development time/effort and to increase stability of resulting
software.

myodbc-util

     This library provides the ODBC system information abstraction
     and portability used by Connector/ODBC.
